require csrf and put cookie parser before csrf


every post req that has a post req.

.all((req,res0 => {
res.render
({
csrf.Token
})
}))

this token will be in a hidden input. vale -> {{csrfToken}} name = +csrf type=hidden -> this is is all inside the formo.

when dubugging this stuff. when you render this page you should be able to inspect this form. and the valueof input hiddent tag is a hash. always check that the ha sh is the value of that input


csrfToken: req.csrfToken();


the .allcsrfProtection middlware is run before the post reuquest and this is what checks for the token

example on github page.

cookie parser is used first the app.use (csrf).
